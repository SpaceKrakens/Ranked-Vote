# ESLint
An ESLint config file have been added for those that want to use it. It is based on 
[Felix Geisend√∂rfer's](http://felixge.de/)[Node.js Style Guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide)
with tweaks to the rules on indentation(4 Spaces instead of 2) and the allowed length of lines (100 instead of 80).  

Currently ESLint is not part of the project. To use it please install it globaly (or without
saving it in the package.json file).
